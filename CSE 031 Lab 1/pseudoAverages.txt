//This section separates the integers to single numbers and adds them together
Declare a temp variable that is the absolute value of the value
Declare sum
While temp is greater than 0
	Sum is the sum value plus the remainder of the temp divided by 10
	Temp becomes temp divided by 10

//Check is the sum is even or odd value using an if statement that checks whether the remainder of sum divided by 2 is 0 or 1, 0 being even and 1 being odd
	
	If the remainder of sum divided by 2 is 0
		avg_even is the avg_even plus the value
		Count_even increases by +1
	Else
		Avg_odd is the avg_odd plus the value
		Count_odd increases by +1

//Calculate the average of the values
Avg_even is avg_even divided by count_even
Avg_odd is avg_odd divided by count_odd
	
If count_even plus count_odd is 0
	“There is no average to compute”
If count_even is not 0
	“Average of input values whose digits sum up to an even number: “ avg_even
If count_odd is not 0
	“Average of input values whose digits sum up to an odd number: “ avg_odd
