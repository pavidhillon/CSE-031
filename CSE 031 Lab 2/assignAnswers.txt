Assignment 1

1. Line 25 caused the segmentation fault. “scanf("%d", input);”
2. I fixed the line so it works properly by adding the “&” symbol. "scanf("%d", &input);"
3. The bug here is that we could not print the final result correctly since the sum variable was not updated outside of the function.
4. To fix it I used “*sum” to dereference the pointer to help modify the actual sum in the main function. I also passed the sum variable so any changes will show in main. 

Assignment 2

1. The output is not expected because it printed “HELLO!hello!.” instead of "HELLO!hello!" as intended. 
2. The output is not expected. It printed “HI!hi!hello!.” instead of HI!hi!" This is because since we ran the program again it was going based on the previous string and not a new one. To fix it I put the "\0" terminator at s1[s1len+s2len] , this way it stopped the string correctly. 
3. The output still is not expected. It printed “thank you! I am fine, thank you! .” I think this happened because the length of the string variable was capped at length10 so it messed it up.
