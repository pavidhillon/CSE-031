The three pools for memory are called Stack, Heap, and Static storage. In their respectable order, 
the variables that are stored are local variables, allocated variables, and global variables.


Three variables are declared; num, ptr, and handle.
Two are pointers, ptr points to an int while handle points to a pointer to an int.
Num, ptr, and handle are stack memory since they are local variables, but in line 10 and 12, 
ptr and handle are in heap memory indicated by “malloc.”
I am assuming you meant line 11 “*ptr = num;”. The pointer will point to heap memory as it was 
allocated to in line 10 using “malloc”.


TPS 2

Defines a structure of Node with three members, iValue, fValue, and next. Then allocates memory
 of the node with the assigned values of iValue = 5 and fValue = 3.14.
printf("Address of head (heap): %p\n", head); printf("Address of head: %p\n", &head); 
printf("Address of iValue: %p, Value: %d\n", &head->iValue, head->iValue); printf("Address of fValue: %p, Value: %f\n", &head->fValue, head->fValue); printf("Address of next: %p, Value: %p\n", &head->next, head->next);
The members of a structure are stored in order, but sometimes there are gaps between
 them to make memory access faster. The pointer head holds the address of the Node structure so it can be used to access the data inside it.
